## Let's get started!


* Inter Number System Conversion

`/extras/fun/ns_converter.py`

> It was made by me when our professor was giving [binary, octal] conversion after conversion.

* Hello, World!

`/coursework/helloworld.c`

> Simply prints "Hello, world!"

* Find Days in a Month

`/coursework/days_in_month.c`

> Prints days in a month by taking month number.

`/extras/fun/gui_python.py`

> GUI Demo in Python

## Want to Contribute?

### Contributions Best Practices :

**Issues**

* Open issues in [issue tracker](https://github.com/0x48piraj/CS-1101-MU/issues) of the program which you want to add.

**Pull Requests**

* In your Pull Requests, always reference the [issue](https://github.com/0x48piraj/CS-1101-MU/issues) you're solving and provide details.

**Commits**

* Write clear meaningful git commit messages *(Avoid profanity.)*

**Feature Requests and Bug Reports**

* When you file a feature request or when you are submitting a bug report to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/0x48piraj/CS-1101-MU/issues), make sure you add steps to reproduce it. Especially if that bug is some weird/rare one.


### Code Structure :

#### Example :
public class application{
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("Hello world");
}
}

*See the code-base to get more insight about the template.*


**Join the development**

* Before you join development, please clone up the project on your local machine, run the codes and go through the repository completely. Run any program you can find and see where it leads to. Explore. 


> *(Don't worry ... Nothing will happen to the app or to you due to the exploring :wink: Only thing that will happen is, you'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the program.)*

* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please feel free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
